    <p>Week 2 was the first week where we started coding. We started simple using code.org
       as an introduction and as a way for people to start coding without worrying about
       the actual line of code.</p>

    <p>Week 3's assignment was made with scratch and while the program is similar to
       code.org, the assignment itself was a bit more complex because we had to create a game or story.</p>
    <p>Week 4 assignments</p>
